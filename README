This game is written in Python 2.7 using pygame module and is tested on Ubuntu 15.10.
Game is just like Flappy Bird. Save the Helicopter (instead of Bird 
in a conventional Flappy Bird Game) from colliding against the Hurdles
and boundaries. Maintain the elevation of helicopter using Arrow Keys.
There's a lot of gravity(ha ha ha..). The speed of hurldles incoming 
increases as the score inscreases.

Requirements:
1. Python 2.7 (sudo apt-get install python)
2. Pygame module (sudo apt-get install python-pygame) 

How to run?

Get into the directory, using terminal, where source files are saved.
Type 'python heli.py' (without quotes) and hit enter.
Enjoy.

Enhancements and Improvements are welcome.
